# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the usage of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries when provided with an empty array.  The unexpected behavior can lead to incorrect results in applications relying on this operator.

## Bug Description
A query using `$in` with an empty array is expected to return all documents, as it represents a condition that is always true. However, MongoDB interprets this as an empty condition, resulting in an empty result set.

## Reproduction
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Run the script `bug.js` which uses an empty array in the `$in` operator.
3.  Observe that the query returns no results.

## Solution
The solution involves handling the empty array case explicitly. If the array is empty, the query should be modified to return all documents.

## Solution Code
The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the solution to the issue.
